This is a creaky old fork of Sinatra that we'll use for an exercise during your interview. Since it's so old, make sure that the dependencies install correctly and that the tests are green on your system

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grouper/old-sinatra.git
cd old-sinatra
bundle
bundle exec rake test:routing
```
